Lab 4.1: Memory Management Basics

a. Discuss the difference between a virtual and a physical address.
    - A virtual address is the address generated by the CPU in a program’s address space. 
        It is used by processes and mapped to a physical address using a memory management unit (MMU).
    - A physical address is the actual location in the computer’s RAM where data is stored. 
        The OS and hardware translate virtual addresses to physical addresses during execution.


b. When is compaction a viable option to reduce external fragmentation?
    Compaction is viable when:
        1. Dynamic memory allocation leads to fragmentation, leaving many small, non-contiguous free memory blocks.
        2. The OS supports relocatable code, allowing processes to be moved in memory.
        3. Performance trade-offs are acceptable, as compaction is time-consuming.
        4. There is no paging, as paging inherently avoids external fragmentation.
