Lab 6.2: Page Replacement Basics
a. The pager (e.g., kswapd on Linux) of some systems tries to always offer a certain amount
of free page frames to improve paging. What is the basic idea behind such a pager?

The basic idea is to proactively maintain a pool of free, pre-cleaned page frames so that when
a page fault occurs, the system can immediately allocate a frame without the delay of cleaning
or swapping out a page. This reduces page fault latency and improves overall system performance.



b. What is thrashing? When does it occur?

Thrashing: The system is busy swapping pages in and out
Each time one page is brought in, another page, whose contents will soon be referenced, is
thrown out
Effect: Low CPU utilization, processes wait for pages to be fetched from disk
Consequence: OS “thinks” that it needs higher degree of multiprogramming [SGG12]


c. What is the working set of a process? How can the working set be used to prevent
thrashing?

Working set of a process: The set of pages that a process actively needs in a given 
time window to execute efficiently without excessive page faults.
Preventing thrashing using the working set:
The working set model ensures that each process gets enough page frames to hold its working set.
