Lab 6.1: Page Fault Handling
a. Explain the terms demand-paging and pre-paging. What are the respective strengths
and weaknesses?

Demand-Paging: Transfer only pages that raise page faults
Demand-paging is a lazy-loading approach where the operating system loads pages into memory 
only when they are actually needed—that is, when a page fault occurs
Strengths:
    memory efficiency: Only transfer what is needed
    Less memory needed per process
Weaknesses:
    “Many” initial page faults when a task starts
    More I/O operations fi More I/O overhead

Pre-Paging: Speculatively transfer pages to RAM
Pre-paging is a proactive approach where the OS speculatively loads additional pages into memory
along with the one that triggered the page fault, based on an estimation of what the process might
need next (e.g., loading an entire section of code).
Strengths:
    Improves disk I/O throughput by reading chunks
Weaknesses:
    Wasted resources: Wastes I/O bandwidth if page is never used
    Interference with other processes: Can destroy the working set of other processes in case of page stealing


b. When a thread touches (either reads or writes) a page for the first time with demand-
paging, a page fault will occur. Classify the page fault according to where the data for
the unmapped page has to be fetched from by the page fault handler.

When a thread accesses a page for the first time under demand-paging, a page fault occurs. 
The OS classifies this fault based on the source of the data for the unmapped page:
Demand-Loaded Fault:
    If the page is part of the program’s executable (code or initialized data), 
    it is fetched from disk (or a memory-mapped file).
Zero-Fill Fault:
If the page is being accessed for the first time for dynamic memory (e.g., stack or heap), 
a new page is allocated and filled with zeros.
So, fault is handled either by loading existing data from disk or by initializing a new, empty page


c. If the process has been running for some time, modifying data along its way, there is
one additional case that needs to be covered on a page fault. Which?

The additional case that needs to be covered on a page fault when a process has been running for some time
and modifying data is handling a dirty page during page replacement.
It checks if the victim page is dirty and, if so, writing it to disk before replacing it with the new page.


d. Discuss which information is required by the page fault handler to correctly setup (or
restore) the contents of accessed pages.

The page fault handler requires:

    Virtual address (from CR2 register) causing the fault.

    Page Table Entry (PTE) metadata (validity, permissions, dirty bit, disk location if swapped).

    Disk location (swap/pagefile or file backing) to restore the page.

    Swap metadata (dirty status and disk location of victim pages for replacement).

    Physical frame allocation (free frames or victim selection).

    Page type (demand-zero, file-backed, anonymous) to initialize/load correctly.

    Address space mappings to update/unmap pages and TLB entries to flush.


e. Can you reuse page table entries to store some of this information? Is it a good idea?

Yes, PTEs can store disk locations and metadata (e.g., dirty/accessed bits),
but hardware support is critical.


f. Recap: Describe the steps necessary to handle a page fault in an application’s address
space.
